# Global-Food-Market-Data-ETL-Pipeline

## Summary: <br>
The aim of this project is to analyze real-time global market data using AWS Kinesis and Snowflake. We utilize CSV datasets extracted via API calls, stream them through Kinesis Firehose, and transform them with Snowflake. Our agile workflow ensures
efficiency, providing a one stop comprehensive solution for real-time data insights. AWS services include S3 for storage, Kinesis Firehose for streaming, Lambda for serverless
computing, AppRunner for deployment of API, Snowpipe for auto ingestion of raw data from destination S3 bucket, Snowpark for processing raw data into cleaned data and
Power BI for data visualization.
<br>

## Dataset Description: <br>
The dataset constitutes a comprehensive view of the global food market across 36 countries and 2,200 markets spanning from January 1, 2007, to May 1, 2023. It includes
detailed information on various aspects such as country specifics, market details, and diverse food items with associated price points (low, high, open, close), inflation rates, and trust indicators for each item.
